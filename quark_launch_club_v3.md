- **Special pilot pricing.**  
- **A free productivity report** of your jobsite—so you can see exactly how robots “pencil out” for your business.  
- **Direct input** on shaping how this technology fits real-world needs.  
- **Marketing spotlight** as an early adopter of jobsite robotics.

## Why Start With Hauling?
Hauling eats up crew time and energy every day. Our hauling robots act like a motorized wheelbarrow—operated by remote control or set to “follow-me” mode—cutting wasted trips, reducing strain, and keeping skilled workers focused on skilled work.

## How It Works
1. **We deliver the robot**—ready to use the same day.  
2. **Quick training**—your crew is up and running in minutes.  
3. **Robots do the hauling**—you steer with remote control or let them follow your crew.  
4. **We provide your free productivity report**—showing how much time, labor, and money you save.

## Who We’re Looking For
Forward-thinking landscapers, subcontractors, and other labor-intensive businesses ready to lead the way in jobsite innovation.
